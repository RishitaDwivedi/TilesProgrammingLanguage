**Programming Language Concepts**

**Overview**
This project entails the design and implementation of a domain-specific programming language (DSL) for specifying tiling patterns. The project is segmented into various problems, each requiring a unique approach to manipulate and produce tiling patterns based on input specifications.
The goal was to create a programming language that enables users to define larger tiles built from smaller ones, with the ability to apply transformations such as rotation, scaling, reflection, and the application of boolean operations on tiles.

**Development Environment**
The project is intended to be compiled and run on Unix/Linux systems.
GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) Version 8.4.3 or earlier should be used for compilation.
